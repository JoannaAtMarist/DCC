Chapter 10
Project 16: Some online stores offer their customers a gift registry, where they can enter items that they would like to receive as gifts for a special event. Let's let the customer rank the gifts in order of preference in the registry. You need to:
1. Design an ADT to represent the gift registry.
2. Implement your ADT in pseudocode using the operations of the ADT list.
3. Implement your ADT using the class OurList. OurList comes from Project 2 in Chapter 10, which states: using the standard class ArrayList, define a class OurList of lists that implement the interface ListInterface, as defined in Listing 10-1 of this chapter.  
You must provide all the code necessary to compile and test your implementation, and submit all Java files.
